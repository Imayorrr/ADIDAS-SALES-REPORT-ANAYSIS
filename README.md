## Data cleaning process
1. The dataset contains 9648 rows and 11 columns
2. I checked for duplicates but there were no duplicates
3. I also checked for blank cells but there no blank cells 
4. I  created a new total revenue column by multiplying the price per unit column with the unit sold column
5. I also created a new column named “total cost” by multiplying  the cost per unit and unit sold column
6. I created another column named “profit ” by subtracting the total revenue column and the total cost column
7. After I was done with cleaning and adding columns, I had 9648 rows and 13 columns

# Analysis insights and recommendation

* South Carolina ranks lowest among the top five making $3.5M in total revenue.
## Recommendation

# 3.	Total revenue by product.
* The chart shows that Men’s Street Footwear generates the highest revenue among all products, followed closely by Women’s Apparel and Men’s Athletic Footwear.

## Insights
* Men’s Street Footwear is the strongest-performing category, indicating high demand for men’s shoes.
* Women’s product categories show mixed performance: women’s apparel performs strongly, while women’s athletic footwear underperforms.
* This suggests varying preferences and possibly differences in product availability, pricing, or marketing effectiveness across gender and category.
## Recommendation 
* Adidas should continue investing in Men’s Footwear, particularly street and athletic segments, as they show strong revenue results.
* For weaker categories like Women’s Athletic Footwear, Adidas should evaluate product range, marketing strategy, and inventory levels to identify improvement opportunities.
* Increasing targeted campaigns for underperforming women’s categories may help balance revenue across product lines.

# 4. Total revenue and profit by region
* The chart compares Total Revenue and Profit across five regions.
* West generates the highest revenue by a wide margin, as well as the highest profit.
* Northeast, Southeast, and South show moderate revenue levels with profits that follow a similar pattern steady but significantly lower than revenue.
* Midwest shows the lowest revenue and profit.

* Although the southeast region made more revenue than the south region, the south region made more profits than the southeast region
## Recommendation
 * Focus on what works in the West by examining pricing, product mix, and operational strategies that are driving its strong performance, and replicate these across other regions.
* Investigate Midwest performance ; Conduct a market review to identify whether the issue is low demand, poor distribution, or competitive pressure, and design targeted interventions.

# 5.	Total Revenue By Quarter

* Revenue then declines in Q4 to  $28M.
## Insights
* Strong growth occurs from Q1 to Q3, indicating favorable business conditions, successful campaigns, or high customer demand.
* Q3 is the peak revenue quarter, suggesting seasonality or concentrated sales activity.
* The noticeable drop in Q4 may indicate reduced demand, lower sales activity or budget closures.
## Recommendation
* Investigate Q4 decline: analyze sales channels, customer activity, and market conditions to identify causes and prevent similar drops in future cycles.
* Leverage Q3 success: identify the strategies that drove the Q3 peak (promotions, product launches, seasonal demand) and consider extending or replicating them in Q4.
* Strengthen Q1 performance by launching early-year promotions or pipeline-building strategies to avoid a slow start.

# CONCLUSION 
* The sales analysis shows that Adidas’ strongest performance comes from a few key areas. New York and California lead as the top revenue-generating states, while Florida, Texas, and South Carolina follow as part of the top five. Sales channels also show a strong shift toward digital, with online sales contributing the highest revenue, followed by outlet and in-store sales.
* In terms of products, Men’s Street Footwear stands out as the best-performing category, with men’s athletic footwear and women’s apparel also driving significant revenue. Meanwhile, women’s athletic footwear and some apparel lines generate comparatively lower revenue.
* The West region performs the strongest in both revenue and profit, while the Midwest lags behind. Revenue increases steadily from Q1 and peaks in Q3 before dropping in Q4. Overall, performance shows strong mid-year momentum but weak end-year results, suggesting seasonal patterns and opportunities to improve consistency across regions and quarters.
