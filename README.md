## Data cleaning process
1. The dataset contains 9648 rows and 11 columns
2. I checked for duplicates but there were no duplicates
3. I also checked for blank cells but there no blank cells 
4. I  created a new total revenue column by multiplying the price per unit column with the unit sold column
5. I also created a new column named “total cost” by multiplying  the cost per unit and unit sold column
6. I created another column named “profit ” by subtracting the total revenue column and the total cost column
7. After I was done with cleaning and adding columns, I had 9648 rows and 13 columns

# Analytical Questions
* How do sales methods (Online, Outlet and In-Store) influence the profit?

* Which product category contributed most to Adidas’ profit?
  
* Which region generated the highest profit for Adidas?
  
* Which retailer contributed the most to the overall profit?
  
* What was the quarterly sales trend?



# Analysis and insights 

# 1. 	Total Profit By Sales Method
* The Total Profit by Sales Method chart reveals that the Online sales generated the highest profit ($19.55M) followed by Outlet sales ($14.91M), and In-store sales ($12.76M).
* This indicates that Adidas performs strongly across all channels, but online is clearly the leading sales method.
## Insights
* Online sales being the top contributor suggests:
* Strong digital presence
* More customers prefer online shopping
## Recommendation
*	Adidas should continue investing in online sales channels through improved user experience, digital marketing, and fast delivery options.
*	Outlet performance is strong and should be maintained.
*	To boost in-store sales, Adidas can introduce targeted promotions, in-store experiences, and product exclusives to attract more physical shoppers.

# 2.	Total profit by product.
* The chart shows that Men’s Street Footwear generates the highest revenue among all products, followed closely by Women’s Apparel and Men’s Athletic Footwear.
* On the lower end, Women’s Athletic Footwear and Men’s Apparel generate the least revenue in comparison to the top products.
## Insights
* Men’s Street Footwear is the strongest-performing category, indicating high demand for men’s shoes.
* Women’s product categories show mixed performance: women’s apparel performs strongly, while women’s athletic footwear underperforms.
* This suggests varying preferences and possibly differences in product availability, pricing, or marketing effectiveness across gender and category.
## Recommendation 
* Adidas should continue investing in Men’s Footwear, particularly street and athletic segments, as they show strong revenue results.
* For weaker categories like Women’s Athletic Footwear, Adidas should evaluate product range, marketing strategy, and inventory levels to identify improvement opportunities.
* Increasing targeted campaigns for underperforming women’s categories may help balance revenue across product lines.

# 3. Total profit by region
* West Region is the strongest performer, it produces the most profit, suggesting strong market demand.
* Northeast, Southeast, and South shows moderate profit levels with profits that follow a similar pattern. 
* Midwest shows the lowest profit.

## Recommendation
* Focus on what works in the West by examining pricing, product mix, and operational strategies that are driving its strong performance, and replicate these across other regions.
* Investigate Midwest performance ; Conduct  a market review to identify whether the issue is low demand, poor distribution, or competitive pressure, and design targeted interventions.

# 4.	Total Revenue By Quarter
* The Quarterly chart shows profit performance across the four quarters:
* profit starts at around $9.7M in Q1.
* It increases steadily through Q2 with $11.9M in profit.
* It peaks in Q3 at approximately $14.1M, the highest point in the year.
* profit then declines in Q4 to  $11.5M.


## Insights
* Strong growth occurs from Q1 to Q3, indicating favorable business conditions, successful campaigns, or high customer demand.
* Q3 is the peak revenue quarter, suggesting seasonality or concentrated sales activity.
* The noticeable drop in Q4 may indicate reduced demand, lower sales activity or budget closures.
## Recommendation
* Investigate Q4 decline: analyze sales channels, customer activity, and market conditions to identify causes and prevent similar drops in future cycles.
* Leverage Q3 success: identify the strategies that drove the Q3 peak (promotions, product launches, seasonal demand) and consider extending or replicating them in Q4.
* Strengthen Q1 performance by launching early-year promotions or pipeline-building strategies to avoid a slow start.

  # 5.Total Profit by Retailer
  The Total Profit by Retailer Chart reveals that;
* West Gear is the top-performing retailer that generated the highest profit by a clear margin.
* Foot Locker and Sports Direct follow closely forming a strong top-three profit group.
* There is a sharp drop in profit after Sports Direct.
* Kohl’s, Amazon and Walmart contribute significantly less profit with Walmart being the lowest among the group.
  ## Recommendation
 *  Invest more in  top retailers (west gear, foot locker, sports direct)
*  Improve visibility and promotions on underperforming platforms



 

# CONCLUSION 
* The sales analysis shows that Adidas’ strongest performance comes from a few key areas. Sales channels show a strong shift toward digital, with online sales contributing the highest revenue, followed by outlet and in-store sales.
* In terms of products, Men’s Street Footwear stands out as the best-performing category, with men’s athletic footwear and women’s apparel also driving significant revenue. Meanwhile, women’s athletic footwear and some apparel lines generate comparatively lower revenue.
* The West region performs the strongest in both revenue and profit, while the Midwest lags behind. Revenue increases steadily from Q1 and peaks in Q3 before dropping in Q4. Overall, performance shows strong mid-year momentum but weak end-year results, suggesting seasonal patterns and opportunities to improve consistency across regions and quarters.
